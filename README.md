To run the code, use the command

ocaml rpn.ml

It will take in standard input indefinitely until you input q, to quit the program.

If an error is met, the Stack should cleared and the program will continue with the next
expression entered.

test.txt contains the 12 tests I have provided. They must be entered one at a time to standard input.
The results are labeled 1 through 12 as well within result.txt

I assumed something will be entered every time, entering a blank line will crash the program.
